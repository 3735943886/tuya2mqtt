# tuya2mqtt: Tuya Devices to MQTT Bridge
[한국어](README.ko.md)

`tuya2mqtt` is a Python script that connects Tuya smart devices to an MQTT broker. **It acts as a backend service that maintains a 24-hour TCP connection with registered Tuya devices. This allows it to instantly publish state changes to MQTT and enable device control via MQTT commands.**
`tuya2mqtt` is daemonized with `python-daemon` to run as a robust and lightweight background process, minimizing overhead and dependencies to maximize performance over a containerized solution.

-----

## Key Features

  * **Tuya Device Control**: Device state can be set via MQTT.
  * **Status Monitoring**: Real-time status updates (DPS) are received from Tuya devices and published to MQTT.
  * **Multithreading**: Each device is handled in a separate thread for stable, concurrent communication.
  * **Daemon Mode**: Runs reliably in the background, with PID file management to prevent multiple instances.
  * **Dynamic Device Management**: Add or remove devices on the fly using MQTT commands.
  * **Wide Device Support**: Control various Tuya devices, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, and BLE.

-----

## Installation

`tuya2mqtt` requires Python 3.8 or later and the following libraries.

```sh
pip install tinytuya paho-mqtt python-daemon
```

-----

## Usage

### **Daemon Mode (default)**

* **Start:** Run the script as a background daemon.
    ```sh
    python tuya2mqtt.py start
    ```

* **Stop:** Safely stop the running daemon.
    ```sh
    python tuya2mqtt.py stop
    ```

* **Restart:** Stop the current daemon instance and start a new one.
    ```sh
    python tuya2mqtt.py restart
    ```

### **Foreground and Debug Mode (advanced)**

* **Foreground:** Run the script in the foreground. Useful for use with service managers like **systemd**.
    ```sh
    python tuya2mqtt.py foreground
    ```

* **Debug:** Run the script in the foreground with real-time debug logs enabled. Useful for **development** and **troubleshooting**.
    ```sh
    python tuya2mqtt.py debug
    ```
-----

## Configuration

Running the script for the first time will automatically create a tuya2mqtt.conf file. This file can be edited to change the MQTT broker information.

**`tuya2mqtt.conf` Example:**

```json
{
  "broker": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 1883
  },
  "topic": {
    "subscribe": {
      "add": "tuya2mqtt/device/add",
      "delete": "tuya2mqtt/device/delete",
      "query": "tuya2mqtt/device/query",
      "set": "tuya2mqtt/device/set",
      "get": "tuya2mqtt/device/get",
      "send": "tuya2mqtt/device/send"
    },
    "publish": {
      "command": "tuya2mqtt/data/command",
      "status": "tuya2mqtt/data/status",
      "daemon": "tuya2mqtt/log/daemon",
      "info": "tuya2mqtt/log/info",
      "debug": "tuya2mqtt/log/debug",
      "error": "tuya2mqtt/log/error"
    }
  }
}
```

## Managing Devices via MQTT

### 1\. Add a Device

[Add devices in bulk using tinytuya wizard](README.add.md)

To add a new Tuya device, publish a JSON payload to the `tuya2mqtt/device/add` topic.

  * **Tuya Wi-Fi Device**: Requires `id`, `ip`, `key`, and `version`. `name` is optional.
    ```json
    {
      "id": "ebed836691xxxxxxb",
      "ip": "192.168.1.100",
      "key": "b4e4776e1f0e21a2",
      "version": 3.3,
      "name": "My_Smart_Plug"
    }
    ```
  * **Tuya Zigbee/BLE Device**: Requires `id`, `node_id`, and `parent` (the hub's ID). `name` is optional.
    ```json
    {
      "id": "ebed836691xxxxxxb",
      "node_id": "01020202111111112222",
      "parent": "ebed836691xxxxxxb",
      "name": "My_Sub_Device"
    }
    ```

### 2\. Control and Query Device Status

To control a device or request its status, publish a payload to the `tuya2mqtt/device/set` or `tuya2mqtt/device/get` topics. **A device can be specified by either its `id` or `name`.**

  * **Set State**: Publish a JSON payload with `data` (DPS) to the `tuya2mqtt/device/set` topic.
      * Using `id`:
        ```json
        {
          "id": "ebed836691xxxxxxb",
          "data": {
            "1": true
          }
        }
        ```
      * Using `name`:
        ```json
        {
          "name": "My_Smart_Plug",
          "data": {
            "1": true
          }
        }
        ```
  * **Get Status**: Publish a JSON payload containing the device's `id` or `name` to the `tuya2mqtt/device/get` topic.
      * Using `id`:
        ```json
        {
          "id": "ebed836691xxxxxxb"
        }
        ```
      * Using `name`:
        ```json
        {
          "name": "My_Smart_Plug"
        }
        ```
  * **Direct Payload Transmission (Advanced Usage)**: To send a direct command to a device, publish a payload containing the command code (`command`, an integer) and data to the `tuya2mqtt/device/send` topic. This is useful for features not covered by the `set` command.
      * Using `id`:
        ```json
        {
          "id": "ebed836691xxxxxxb",
          "command": 18,
          "data": [1, 2, 3]
        }
        ```
### 3\. Monitor Devices via MQTT

`tuya2mqtt` provides two main topics for device monitoring. By subscribing to these topics, real-time updates on device status changes and command history can be obtained.

* `tuya2mqtt/data/command`: This topic is used for instant updates. It publishes when **a Tuya device reports a state change on its own**, like when a smart button is pressed or a switch is physically toggled.

* `tuya2mqtt/data/status`: This topic is for status reports. It publishes in **response to a `tuya2mqtt/device/get`** or as a part of a periodic device status check.

Data can be received in this format by subscribing to the topic:

```bash
$ mosquitto_sub -t tuya2mqtt/data/command
```

```json
{"id": "ebed836691xxxxxxb", "name": "My_Smart_Plug", "data": {"1": true}}
{"id": "ebed836691xxxxxxb", "name": "My_Smart_Plug", "data": {"1": false}}
```

The **`id`** field represents the `id` for Wi-Fi devices and the `node_id` for sub-devices.

### 4\. Daemon Status and Shutdown

To query the daemon's status or shut down all device connections, publish a payload to the `tuya2mqtt/device/query` topic.

  * **Query Daemon Status**:

    ```json
    {
      "status": true
    }
    ```

    The response will be published to the `tuya2mqtt/log/daemon` topic.

  * **Reset All Device Connections**:

    ```json
    {
      "reset": true
    }
    ```

    This command terminates communication with all currently connected devices. The daemon process itself remains active, but the `add` command must be used to reconnect devices.

  * **Terminate All Connections and Shut Down Daemon**:

    ```json
    {
      "stop": true
    }
    ```

    This command is equivalent to `python tuya2mqtt.py stop`. It terminates all device connections and shuts down the daemon completely.

## Important Notes & Recommendations

This script is intentionally streamlined and focused on **robustness**. However, it relies on several external dependencies.

  * **External Module Dependencies**: `tuya2mqtt` relies entirely on the `tinytuya` and `paho-mqtt` modules. Unexpected updates to these modules can impact the script's stability, so keeping the module versions stable is recommended.
    * **[tinytuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya)**
    * **[paho-mqtt](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python)**
  * **Network Resources**: As the number of Tuya devices increases, a large number of **TCP connections will be kept alive**. This can put a significant load on a router's resources, so a router with sufficient capacity should be used.
  * **MQTT Broker Environment**: As device connections and communication become more frequent, the MQTT broker may experience increased load. For **maximum performance**, this script is designed not to use additional security features like TLS. To ensure security, external access to the broker should be prevented and it should be operated directly on `localhost`.
  * **File Descriptors**: The script sets the maximum file descriptor (FD) limit at startup to handle a large number of concurrent device connections.
